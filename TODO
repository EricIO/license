Some things that I wan't to do (feel free to do it yourself)

Add support for adding license information to individual files. This is what the .small files
are there for.

	- Prepend the .small text onto the project files
	- Determine what characters are used for comments
	- Let the user determine what files the license info should be prepended to
	- Most licenses comes with <author> and <year> information that needs to be added, would be nice to add automatically.
